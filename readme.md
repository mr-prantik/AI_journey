# AI Learning Journey

Hi! I'm just starting out on my exciting journey to learn about Artificial Intelligence (AI). This repository will serve as a space to document my learnings, practice code, and track my progress.

Here, I'll be summarizing key concepts I learn about different areas of AI. 

* **Machine Learning**
    * Summaries of key concepts (e.g., supervised learning, algorithms)
    * Links to helpful resources (articles, tutorials, videos)
* **Deep Learning** 


* **Future Exploration:**
    * I'm eager to learn more about Natural Language Processing (NLP) and its applications.
* **Tools & Technologies:**
    * Programming Language: Python
    * Libraries/Frameworks: TensorFlow/PyTorch
